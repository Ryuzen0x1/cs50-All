# Scratch (scratch.mit.edu)

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) is a free, block-based visual programming language and online community developed by the MIT Media Lab. It is designed primarily for learning logic in codes for ages 8-16, but it's used by people of all ages to create games, animations, stories, and interactive projects [like CS50].

## 🌟 Features

- **Block-Based Coding**: Drag-and-drop code blocks make programming accessible and fun.
- **Creative Projects**: Users can build animations, games, and interactive stories.
- **Community Sharing**: Share projects, comment on others, remix code, and collaborate.
